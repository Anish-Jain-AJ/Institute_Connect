# Institute_Connect
This is an android app for connecting students and faculties of an institute.
It does not have back-end and only shows the front-end User Interface of the app.

This app uses following things to design the front-end part of the app:
1) Animation Drawable for color changing activity.
2) Navigation View and Drawer Layout.
3) Spinner for a drop-down menu.
4) Basic relative layout along with other features.

This application was developed using Android Studio.

It shows a first screen where a person can login and register, whether it be student or faculty and then after logging in, a particular
activity opens and gives the required features to the person who has logged in.
